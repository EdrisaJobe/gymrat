        <em>Exercise controls weight</em> Exercise can help prevent excess
        weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical
        activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more
        calories you burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry
        if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any
        amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of
        exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs
        instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is
        key when maintaining a high level of activity and seeing results.
      </p>

        <em>Exercise combats health conditions and diseases</em>
        Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No
        matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density
        lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases
        unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing
        smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Regular
        exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns,
        including:

        <br />
        <br />• Stroke <br />• Metabolic syndrome <br />• High blood pressure
        <br />• Type 2 diabetes <br />• Depression <br />• Anxiety <br />• Many
        types of cancer <br />• Arthritis <br />• Falls

        <br /><br />
        It can also help improve cognitive function and helps lower the risk of
        death from all causes.

        <em>Exercise improves mood</em> Need an emotional lift? Or need to
        destress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help.
        Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you
        feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. You may also feel better
        about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which
        can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.

        <em>Conclusion</em> Exercise and physical activity are great
        ways to feel better, boost your health and have fun. For most healthy
        adults, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends
        these exercise guidelines: 
        
        <br><br>• Aerobic activity. Get at least 150 minutes of
        moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a
        week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. The guidelines
        suggest that you spread out this exercise during the course of a week.
        To provide even greater health benefit and to assist with weight loss or
        maintaining weight loss, at least 300 minutes a week is recommended. But
        even small amounts of physical activity are helpful. Being active for
        short periods of time throughout the day can add up to provide health
        benefit. 
        
        <br><br>• Strength training. Do strength training exercises for all major
        muscle groups at least two times a week. Aim to do a single set of each
        exercise using a weight or resistance level heavy enough to tire your
        muscles after about 12 to 15 repetitions. 
        
        <br><br>Moderate aerobic exercise
        includes activities such as brisk walking, biking, swimming and mowing
        the lawn. Vigorous aerobic exercise includes activities such as running,
        heavy yardwork and aerobic dancing. Strength training can include use of
        weight machines, your own body weight, heavy bags, resistance tubing or
        resistance paddles in the water, or activities such as rock climbing.
